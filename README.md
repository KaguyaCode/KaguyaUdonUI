# KaguyaUdonUI

## Kaguya Time of Day
These scripts are for setting time of day buttons up in UI. They don't change the time of day, they're just some functional UI so that it can be clear in an instance what time has been set by others, and to give some nicer feedback, since usually the time of day is either subtle or on an animation. Designed for use either standalone or with Sylantroh's GM Menu.
